#+Title: Doom Emacs Configuration
* Introduction
This is my [[https:github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]] configuration it has taken heavy inspiration from multiple
sources and is now and will always be a work in progress.
** References
Some sources of inspiration (and more often than not direct plagiarism) are as follows:

- [[https:zzamboni.org/post/my-doom-emacs-configuration-with-commentary/][Zzamboni's Emacs Config]]
- [[https:tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html][Tecosaur’s Emacs config]]

I highly recommend checking out these and other examples of emacs configurations
(doomemacs or otherwise) as that's how I've learned all the best tips. Each
configuration is highly unique and some of the choices made here will be other
than what you would pick but it works for me so I'll take no judgment.

** File Layout
As this configuration is responsible for generating all my other emacs config
files it seems the most logical to get this out of the way early on. From this
configuration the following files are generated:

- =init.el=: Outlines what [[https:github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#modules][doom modules]] will be enabled and other configuration
  that needs to occur early in the loading sequence, the majority of this can be
  found in the [[Doom Block]] section.
- =packages.el=: Outlines the packages to install and exactly how to install
  them when additional configuration is necessary.
- =config.el=: If it doesn't fit into the above categories than this is where
  it's gonna go typically is just the /general/ configuration.

Without any further preamble let's get to the configuration.
*** File Headers
To keep the headers of these files from cluttering the rest of this file they
are given here, they contain information that is automatically included when
installing doom and various other information about the file.

;; NOTE Press 'SPC h d h' (or 'C-h d h' for non-vim users) to access Doom's
;;      documentation. There you'll find a "Module Index" link where you'll find
;;      a comprehensive list of Doom's modules and what flags they support.

;; NOTE Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press 'K' (or
;;      'C-c c k' for non-vim users) to view its documentation. This works on
;;      flags as well (those symbols that start with a plus).
;;
;;      Alternatively, press 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') on a module to browse its
;;      directory (for easy access to its source code).

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
;; This is a file generated from a literate programing source file located at
;; https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/dot-doom/-/blob/master/doom.org
;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t)

;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here and run 'doom sync'
;; on the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
;; use 'M-x doom/reload'.

;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
;; `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;;(package! another-package
;;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;;(package! this-package
;;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here
;; with the `:disable' property:
;;(package! builtin-package :disable t)

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
;; all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
;;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
;; This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
;; our package manager can't deal with; see raxod502/straight.el#279)
;;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))

;; Use `:pin' to specify a particular commit to install.
;;(package! builtin-package :pin "1a2b3c4d5e")

;; Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
;; release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...
;;(unpin! pinned-package)
;; ...or multiple packages
;;(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)
;; ...Or *all* packages (NOT RECOMMENDED; will likely break things)
;;(unpin! t)

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
;; This is a file generated from a literate programing source file located at
;; https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/dot-doom/-/blob/master/doom.org
;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t)

;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!

;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets.
;; (setq user-full-name "John Doe"
;;      user-mail-address "john@doe.com")

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
;; (setq doom-theme 'doom-one)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
;; (setq org-directory "~/org/")

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
;; (setq display-line-numbers-type t)

;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.

** Using Emacs Customize
[[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/docs/faq.org#why-does-doom-discourage-the-use-of-m-x-customize][Doom does not recommend the Emacs =customize= mechanism:]]

All necessary settings are therefore set by hand as part of this configuration
file. The only exceptions are "safe variable" and "safe theme" settings, which
are automatically saved by Emacs in =custom.el=, but this is OK as they don't
conflict with anything else from the config.

* Modules
** Doom Block
This generates the ~doom!~ block of ~init.el~ which defines what should be
loaded into doom emacs. Currently I only rely on modules provided by doom itself
but any additions I may make will be described in their own section below the
doom block.

**** Configuration
* Temporary Fixes
Here is a place where I can place /temporary/ fixes to bugs that have cropped up
while using my configuration. I say that they are temporary because they are
typically a less than ideal solution for when I don't feel like going and
actually fixing the problem.

** Appearance
*** Theme
There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
available. You can either set ~doom-theme~ or manually load a theme with the
~load-theme~ function.

*** Fonts
Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom:

- `doom-font' -- the primary font to use
- `doom-variable-pitch-font' -- a non-monospace font (where applicable)
- `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
presentations or streaming.
- `doom-symbol-font' -- for symbols
- `doom-serif-font' -- for the `fixed-pitch-serif' face

See 'C-h v doom-font' for documentation and more examples of what they
accept. For example:

If you or Emacs can't find your font, use 'M-x describe-font' to look them
up, `M-x eval-region' to execute elisp code, and 'M-x doom/reload-font' to
refresh your font settings. If Emacs still can't find your font, it likely
wasn't installed correctly. Font issues are rarely Doom issues!
